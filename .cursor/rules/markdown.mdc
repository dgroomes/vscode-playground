# Markdown Conventions

These conventions apply generally to Markdown files, but they especially apply to my [README.md](mdc:README.md) file. 
This is a naive first attempt at codifying my rules.


## Formatting Rules

- Section headers: Use H2 (`##`) with simple text in title case
- Section spacing: Double newlines between the end of a section and the beginning of another section
- Code Blocks: Specifically marked with language identifiers (shell for commands, text for output)
- Line length: target around 120 characters. Overflow for long words, URLs, etc.
- List items: indented with 2 spaces. Use asterisks not hyphens.


## Wish List Conventions

- DONE and SKIPPED tasks should eventually be moved out of the "Wish List" section and into a "Finished Wish List Items" section
